Mathex
===

Brief
---

I've created this library as a starter to group the extra math functions that are missing from the standard Go math package to fit my personal future development needs.

More functions are planned to be added soon, currently however, My focus is adding what I need for my other Go projects.

> **Note:** The library is still in a very early stage.
